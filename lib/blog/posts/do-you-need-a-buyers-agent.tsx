      question: 'Can you legally buy a house without a buyer\'s agent?',
      answer: 'Yes. There is no state in the U.S. that requires a buyer to have representation. You have the legal right to represent yourself in any real estate transaction. Listing agents are accustomed to working with unrepresented buyers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will listing agents refuse to work with unrepresented buyers?',
      answer: 'No. Listing agents have a fiduciary duty to their seller, which includes presenting all legitimate offers. Many listing agents actually prefer working with direct buyers because it simplifies the transaction.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does a buyer\'s agent cost on a $400,000 home?',
      answer: 'A typical buyer\'s agent commission is 2-3% of the sale price. On a $400,000 home, that\'s $8,000 to $12,000. On a 30-year mortgage at 7%, that cost baked into the price adds roughly $24,000 in total payments over the life of the loan.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What changed with buyer agent commissions after the NAR settlement?',
      answer: 'The 2024 NAR settlement ended the practice of listing buyer-agent commissions on the MLS. Sellers are no longer automatically expected to pay the buyer\'s agent. Buyers must now sign a written agreement with their agent before touring homes, and commissions are negotiated separately.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What can\'t a buyer\'s agent do?',
      answer: 'Buyer\'s agents cannot give legal advice (they\'re not attorneys), assess the condition of a home (they\'re not inspectors), determine market value (they\'re not appraisers), or negotiate your mortgage terms (they\'re not lenders). They primarily provide coordination, negotiation, and local market knowledge.',

      <p>
        A friend of mine closed on a house last spring. Three-bedroom ranch in a decent school district, listed at $385,000. She made an offer, negotiated a bit, and closed in about five weeks. Pretty standard transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        What wasn&apos;t standard: she didn&apos;t use a buyer&apos;s agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one showed her the house except the listing agent (who was happy to let her in). No one wrote her offer except her, using the state-approved purchase agreement form. And no one collected a buyer-side commission at closing. That money&mdash;roughly $9,600 at 2.5%&mdash;simply didn&apos;t change hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        She told me afterward that the hardest part wasn&apos;t the process. It was figuring out whether she was <em>allowed</em> to do it in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        That confusion is more common than you&apos;d think. So let&apos;s clear it up.
      </p>

      <h2>First, the Basics: What Does a Buyer&apos;s Agent Actually Do?</h2>
      <p>
        A buyer&apos;s agent is a licensed real estate agent who represents the person buying a home. Their job is to help you find properties, arrange showings, write offers, negotiate terms, and guide you through to closing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most transactions, the buyer&apos;s agent earns a commission&mdash;typically between 2% and 3% of the sale price. For decades, that commission was baked into the listing agreement. The seller agreed to pay both their own agent&apos;s fee and the buyer&apos;s agent&apos;s fee, and those costs were built into the sale price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s where things get interesting: buyers were told this service was &ldquo;free.&rdquo; And technically, they weren&apos;t writing a check for it. But the money came from the sale price they were paying. So in a roundabout way, buyers were funding both sides of the commission all along.
      </p>

      <h2>What Changed in 2024 (And Why It Matters Now)</h2>
      <p>
        In 2024, the National Association of Realtors settled a major antitrust lawsuit. The details are dense, but the practical effect was simple: buyer-agent commissions can no longer be advertised on the MLS as part of the listing. Sellers are no longer automatically expected to pay the buyer&apos;s agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn&apos;t mean sellers <em>can&apos;t</em> still offer compensation to a buyer&apos;s agent&mdash;they can. But it&apos;s now negotiable and separate. And buyers are now required to sign a written agreement with their agent before that agent can show them a home.
      </p>
      <p>
        What this settlement really did was pull back the curtain. It forced the industry to be more transparent about who&apos;s paying whom and for what. And it opened the door for buyers to ask a question that used to feel almost taboo: <strong>do I actually need to hire one of these people?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a deeper dive into the settlement itself, see our guide: <a href="/blog/nar-settlement-explained">NAR Settlement Explained: What It Means for Home Buyers in 2026</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>So&hellip; Do You?</h2>
      <p>
        The honest answer is: it depends on your situation. Let&apos;s look at what a buyer&apos;s agent provides, and where the gaps are.
      </p>

      <h2>What Agents Do Well</h2>
      <p>
        A good buyer&apos;s agent knows the local market. They can tell you whether a neighborhood is appreciating or flattening. They know which builders have quality issues and which HOAs are a headache. They&apos;ve seen hundreds of transactions and can spot red flags that a first-time buyer might miss.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also handle logistics. Setting up showings, coordinating with listing agents, tracking deadlines, making sure your earnest money gets deposited on time. For a busy person, that has real value.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in a negotiation, a skilled agent knows how to frame an offer, when to push back, and when to let something go. That&apos;s worth something.
      </p>

      <h2>What Agents Don&apos;t Do (That People Think They Do)</h2>
      <p>
        This is where the confusion lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Buyer&apos;s agents are not attorneys.</strong> They cannot give you legal advice. In most states, the purchase contract is a fill-in-the-blank form approved by a state real estate commission or a bar association. Your agent fills in the blanks, but they&apos;re not interpreting contract law for you. If something goes sideways, you&apos;ll need a real estate attorney.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Agents are not home inspectors.</strong> They might point out a crack in the foundation during a showing, but they&apos;re not qualified to assess the condition of the home. You&apos;ll hire an inspector for that regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>They&apos;re not appraisers.</strong> Your lender orders the appraisal, and the appraiser determines the home&apos;s market value independently. Your agent has no role in that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>And they&apos;re not mortgage brokers.</strong> They might recommend a lender, but your financing terms&mdash;rate, loan type, down payment&mdash;are between you and your lender.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you subtract the things agents <em>can&apos;t</em> actually do, what&apos;s left is primarily coordination, negotiation, and local market knowledge. Those are legitimate services. But they&apos;re not irreplaceable.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Misconceptions About Going Without an Agent</h2>

      <h3>&ldquo;You can&apos;t buy a house without an agent.&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>
        You absolutely can. There is no state in the U.S. that requires a buyer to have representation. You have the legal right to represent yourself in a real estate transaction, full stop. Listing agents are accustomed to working with unrepresented buyers. It happens more often than people realize.
      </p>

      <h3>&ldquo;Listing agents won&apos;t work with you.&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>
        Listing agents have a fiduciary duty to their seller, and that duty includes presenting all offers. If you submit a legitimate offer, they must present it. Refusing to work with an unrepresented buyer would be a violation of their professional obligations. In practice, many listing agents actually <em>prefer</em> working with direct buyers because it simplifies the transaction.
      </p>

      <h3>&ldquo;You&apos;ll overpay without someone negotiating for you.&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>
        Negotiation isn&apos;t magic. It&apos;s math and preparation. If you know the comparable sales in the area, understand the seller&apos;s motivation, and know what contingencies to include, you can negotiate effectively. Agents don&apos;t have access to secret data. The comps are the comps. What matters is whether you&apos;ve done your homework.
      </p>

      <h3>&ldquo;The agent&apos;s commission is paid by the seller, so it&apos;s free.&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>
        This was always a bit misleading, and post-settlement, it&apos;s becoming less true by the day. Even when the seller is technically paying the buyer-agent commission, that cost is factored into the listing price. The buyer is funding it through their purchase price and, by extension, their mortgage. You&apos;re paying interest on that commission for 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, with commissions decoupled from the listing, a seller who doesn&apos;t have to pay a buyer&apos;s agent commission has less to pay out at closing. That&apos;s real money that can stay on the table&mdash;or be redirected into the negotiation.
      </p>

      <h2>The Math That Most People Don&apos;t Run</h2>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s make this concrete. Say you&apos;re buying a $400,000 home.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical buyer-agent commission is 2.5%. That&apos;s <strong>$10,000</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the seller was expecting to pay that $10,000 to your agent, and you show up without one, the seller&apos;s net cost just dropped by $10,000. That gives you negotiating room. You could ask for a lower price. You could ask the seller to cover more of your closing costs. You could negotiate repairs or credits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point isn&apos;t that you pocket $10,000 automatically. It&apos;s that $10,000 is now available in the transaction that wasn&apos;t before. How you use it is up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a 30-year mortgage at 7%, that $10,000 baked into the price would cost you about <strong>$23,900 in total payments</strong>. So the real question isn&apos;t just &ldquo;do I need an agent?&rdquo; It&apos;s &ldquo;is the service I&apos;m getting worth $24,000 over the life of my loan?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        For some buyers, the answer is yes. For others&mdash;especially repeat buyers, people with real estate experience, or anyone willing to do some legwork&mdash;the answer is clearly no.
      </p>

      <h2>Where Buyers Actually Get Confused</h2>
      <p>
        The process itself isn&apos;t what trips people up. It&apos;s the uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most buyers don&apos;t know what they don&apos;t know. They&apos;re not sure which forms to use, what timelines matter, or how to communicate with a listing agent without sounding inexperienced. They worry about making a legal mistake, even though the contracts are standardized. They worry about missing a deadline, even though every deadline is spelled out in the agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        That uncertainty is what agents sell. And it&apos;s a fair product to sell&mdash;for the right buyer, at the right price. But uncertainty is also something you can solve with information and structure. You don&apos;t necessarily need a person collecting a five-figure fee to solve it.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Should Probably Still Use a Buyer&apos;s Agent</h2>
      <p>
        To be fair, there are situations where hiring an agent makes good sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you&apos;re buying in an unfamiliar market and you don&apos;t know the neighborhoods, school zones, or pricing patterns, a local agent can save you real time and potentially real money. If you&apos;re in a highly competitive market where multiple-offer situations are common, an agent with strong relationships can help you get your offer seen. And if you genuinely don&apos;t want to manage the logistics yourself, the convenience has value.
      </p>
      <p>
        There&apos;s no shame in hiring help when help is needed. The goal isn&apos;t to prove you can do it alone. The goal is to make an informed decision about whether you need to.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Self-Represented Buying Is Right For</h2>
      <p>
        Self-represented home buying tends to work best for people who are comfortable asking questions, willing to do some research, and able to stay organized through a 30-to-60-day process. If you&apos;ve bought a home before, you already know much of what an agent would tell you. If you&apos;re detail-oriented and comfortable reading contracts (they&apos;re not that complicated&mdash;really), you&apos;re better equipped than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s also increasingly common. The <a href="/blog/nar-settlement-explained">NAR settlement</a> didn&apos;t just change how commissions work&mdash;it normalized the idea that buyers have choices. And as more buyers explore those choices, the stigma around self-representation is fading fast.
