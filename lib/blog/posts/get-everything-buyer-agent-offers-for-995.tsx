      question: 'What is BAIRE?',
      answer: "BAIRE is an educational technology platform built for self-represented home buyers. It provides comp analysis guidance, offer strategy, negotiation frameworks, inspection interpretation, and closing support — the same knowledge an agent provides, without the five-figure commission. BAIRE is not a brokerage, does not represent you, and does not collect a commission.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does BAIRE cost?',
      answer: "BAIRE costs $995 one time. Not financed, not embedded in your loan, not compounding for 30 years. You also get a 7-day free trial with full access before paying anything. There's a 30-day money-back guarantee after purchase.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does BAIRE compare to a buyer's agent?",
      answer: "On a $400,000 home, a traditional buyer's agent costs roughly $10,000–$12,000 (or $24,000+ financed over 30 years). BAIRE provides the same core knowledge — comp analysis, offer strategy, negotiation coaching, inspection guidance, closing support — for $995 one time. The difference: BAIRE educates and empowers you to make your own decisions rather than acting on your behalf.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Does BAIRE replace a real estate attorney?',
      answer: "No. BAIRE helps you understand real estate documents, processes, and strategy, but it does not provide legal advice. BAIRE recommends hiring a real estate attorney for contract review — typically $500–$1,500 — which provides genuine legal protection that your agent couldn't give you anyway.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is BAIRE best for?',
      answer: "BAIRE is designed for buyers who do their own research, compare options, and want to understand every step of the biggest financial transaction of their life. If you're the type who reads reviews before buying a dishwasher and compares mortgage rates across lenders, BAIRE was built for you.",

      <p>
        <strong>The short version:</strong> BAIRE is a $995 flat-fee platform that provides self-represented home buyers with comp analysis guidance, offer strategy, negotiation coaching, inspection interpretation, and closing support — the same core knowledge a buyer&apos;s agent provides, without the $10,000–$15,000 commission. It&apos;s not a brokerage and doesn&apos;t represent you. It educates and empowers you to represent yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        You&apos;ve seen <a href="/blog/buyer-agent-isnt-free">where the money goes</a>. You&apos;ve run <a href="/blog/true-cost-buyer-agent-30-year-mortgage">the 30-year math</a>. You&apos;ve looked at <a href="/blog/five-things-paying-buyer-agent-12000">the five things an agent does</a> and realized that none of them is out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining question is practical: if you&apos;re going to do this yourself, what does the support structure look like?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because &quot;doing it yourself&quot; doesn&apos;t mean doing it blind. It means having access to the same knowledge, strategy, and process guidance an agent would provide — without the five-figure commission attached.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&apos;s the gap <a href="/">BAIRE</a> was designed to fill.
      </p>

      <h2>What BAIRE Is (and What It Isn&apos;t)</h2>
      <p>
        BAIRE is not a brokerage. It doesn&apos;t hold a real estate license. It doesn&apos;t represent you in your transaction, and it doesn&apos;t collect a commission. It&apos;s a platform built specifically for self-represented home buyers — a guided system that provides the knowledge, tools, and structure you need to navigate a real estate purchase with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it as the difference between hiring a personal trainer and having a detailed, expert-built workout program. Both can get you to the same place. One costs considerably more than the other.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Maps to What Agents Actually Do</h2>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s go service by service and show you how BAIRE covers the same ground.
      </p>

      <h3>Property Evaluation and Market Context</h3>
      <p>
        A buyer&apos;s agent tells you what they think about a neighborhood, based on their personal experience. That&apos;s useful, but it&apos;s one person&apos;s perspective, shaped by whatever part of the market they&apos;ve worked in.
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE draws on research synthesized from thousands of real estate professionals and transaction datasets. Want to understand pricing trends in a specific ZIP code? Need context on school zones, HOA patterns, or flood risk in an area you&apos;re exploring? The system gives you answers grounded in data, not a single agent&apos;s anecdotal experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        You still search for properties on whatever platform you prefer — Zillow, Redfin, the local MLS portal. BAIRE helps you evaluate what you find.
      </p>

      <h3>Comp Analysis and Offer Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        This is one of the highest-value things a good agent does. Get the comps wrong, and you overpay. Lowball it, and you lose the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE walks you through how to pull and interpret comparable sales. Not just &quot;look at these three houses&quot; — but how to adjust for differences in square footage, condition, lot size, and upgrades. How to weight a comp that sold two months ago differently from one that sold six months ago. How to factor in market momentum and days on market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, when it&apos;s time to structure your offer, BAIRE helps you think through the variables: price relative to comps, earnest money, contingencies, timeline, whether to request seller concessions. You&apos;re not guessing. You&apos;re working from a framework that covers the same analytical ground an experienced agent would.
      </p>

      <h3>Contract Navigation</h3>
      <p>
        An agent fills in your purchase agreement form. BAIRE helps you understand what every section means and how to complete it correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which contingencies should you include, and which ones are risky to waive? What&apos;s a smart inspection window? When does your financing contingency expire, and what happens if it does? What are your options if the appraisal comes in low?
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE doesn&apos;t fill out the form for you — it&apos;s not a brokerage, and it doesn&apos;t practice law. But it gives you the knowledge to do it confidently, and it recommends hiring a real estate attorney for contract review. That&apos;s a $500 to $1,500 service that provides genuine legal protection — something your agent couldn&apos;t give you anyway, because agents aren&apos;t lawyers.
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation Coaching</h3>
      <p>
        This is the part that keeps people up at night. What do I say when the seller counters at $5,000 more than I want to pay? How hard do I push? Am I going to blow up the deal?
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE provides negotiation frameworks and language tailored to your situation. Counter-offer strategy. How to handle a low counter. When to hold firm and when a concession makes strategic sense. How to use your unrepresented status as leverage — because a seller who doesn&apos;t have to pay a buyer-agent commission keeps more money from your offer, even at a lower price.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guidance adapts to where you are in the process, the dynamics of your specific deal, and what you&apos;ve told the system about your priorities. It&apos;s not a generic script. It&apos;s shaped by patterns from thousands of real transactions.
      </p>

      <h3>Inspection Interpretation and Repair Negotiation</h3>
      <p>
        You get a 40-page inspection report. Most of it reads like a foreign language. What&apos;s actually a problem, and what&apos;s just inspector boilerplate?
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE helps you sort through it. Structural and safety items get flagged as priorities. Cosmetic issues get contextualized. High-cost items get distinguished from routine maintenance. And when it&apos;s time to ask the seller for repairs or credits, BAIRE helps you frame the request — proportionally, professionally, in a way that keeps the deal moving.
      </p>

      <h3>Closing Support</h3>
      <p>
        From contract to keys, there are a dozen deadlines that matter. Miss one and you&apos;re exposed. BAIRE provides timeline guidance: what&apos;s due when, what to watch for at each milestone, what to do if something stalls.
      </p>
      <p>
        It walks you through your Closing Disclosure. It helps you compare it to your Loan Estimate. It flags the things you should question. So that closing day isn&apos;t a blur of paperwork but a structured process you actually understand.
      </p>

      <h2>The Numbers, Side by Side</h2>
      <p>
        On a $400,000 home, a traditional buyer&apos;s agent commission at 2.5% is $10,000. Financed into a 30-year mortgage at 7%, the real cost is roughly $23,950.
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE costs $995. One time. Not financed. Not embedded in your loan. Not compounding for three decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that $995, you get comp analysis guidance, offer strategy, negotiation coaching, inspection interpretation, closing support, pre-qualification guidance, showing scripts for contacting listing agents, and an exit playbook if things go sideways and you need to walk away cleanly.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also get a 7-day free trial with full access — no feature gates, no limited preview. You see the complete system and decide if it works for you before spending a dollar.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Works For</h2>
      <p>
        BAIRE isn&apos;t for every buyer. If you want someone to physically drive you to homes, hold your hand through every step, and handle all communication on your behalf — you want a traditional agent. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you&apos;re the type of person who does their own research — who reads the reviews before buying a dishwasher, who compares mortgage rates across four lenders, who wants to understand what&apos;s happening at every step of the biggest financial transaction of their life — this was built for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s for the buyer who ran the commission math and thought: there has to be a better way.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s for the buyer who doesn&apos;t want to be kept out of the loop on their own purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s for the buyer who looked at what agents actually do and realized they could handle it themselves — with the right structure behind them.
      </p>
