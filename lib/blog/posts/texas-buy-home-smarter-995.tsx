        You know <a href="/blog/texas-buyer-agent-commissions">the commission math</a>. You&apos;ve seen the <a href="/blog/texas-how-to-buy-without-agent-trec">TREC process laid out step by step</a>. You understand that <a href="/blog/texas-listing-agents-unrepresented-buyers">listing agents in Texas aren&apos;t going to slam the door</a> in your face for not having representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let&apos;s put it all together. What does it actually cost to buy a home the traditional way in Texas versus using a platform built for self-represented buyers? And what do you get in each scenario?
      </p>

      <h2>The Traditional Path: What You&apos;re Paying</h2>
      <p>
        You&apos;re buying a $425,000 home in the DFW metro. You&apos;ve signed a buyer-agency agreement with an agent, and their commission is 2.75%.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&apos;s $11,687 at closing. If it&apos;s embedded in the purchase price (as it historically has been), you&apos;re financing it. Over 30 years at 7%, that commission costs you approximately <a href="/blog/true-cost-buyer-agent-30-year-mortgage">$27,980 in total mortgage payments</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that money, your agent searched for listings you were already finding on Zillow, scheduled showings by calling listing agents, filled in the TREC 1-4 form (the same fill-in-the-blank template you can download from the TREC website), communicated counter-offers via email, and reminded you about your inspection deadline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was it helpful? Probably. Was it $28,000 worth of helpful? That&apos;s the question.
      </p>

      <h2>The Self-Represented Path with BAIRE: What You&apos;re Paying</h2>
      <p>
        Same home. Same $425,000 purchase. But this time, you&apos;re representing yourself with BAIRE as your guided system.
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE costs $995. One payment. Not financed into your loan. Not compounding for 30 years. Not embedded in the purchase price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your total professional costs for the transaction might look something like this: $995 for BAIRE, $500 for a Texas real estate attorney to review your TREC contract (optional but recommended for first-time self-represented buyers), and $450 for a home inspection. That&apos;s $1,945 in total support costs&mdash;compared to $11,687 for the agent commission alone.
      </p>

      <h2>What BAIRE Provides in a Texas Transaction</h2>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s map this to the Texas-specific process, because the state details matter.
      </p>

      <h3>Pre-Qualification Guidance</h3>
      <p>
        BAIRE walks you through what lenders look for, how to compare rates effectively, and how to maximize your pre-approval amount without overextending. For Texas buyers specifically, BAIRE covers VA loan eligibility (relevant for the state&apos;s large veteran population), USDA options for rural Texas areas, and Texas-specific down payment assistance programs.
      </p>

      <h3>Comp Analysis Education</h3>
      <p>
        BAIRE helps you understand how to pull and interpret comparable sales for Texas markets. How to adjust for differences in square footage, lot size, and finishes. How to account for the rapid price shifts that can happen in fast-moving metros like Austin and DFW. How to use public data from HAR.com, NTREIS, and national portals to form a grounded pricing opinion.
      </p>

      <h3>Offer Preparation and TREC Form Guidance</h3>
      <p>
        BAIRE provides a step-by-step framework for completing the TREC 1-4. What to put in each field. How to set your option fee and option period. How to structure earnest money. When to include financing or appraisal contingencies and when they&apos;re already addressed by the option period&apos;s termination right.
      </p>
      <p>
        BAIRE doesn&apos;t fill out the form for you&mdash;it&apos;s not a brokerage and it doesn&apos;t practice law. But it provides the knowledge so you understand every section before you write in a single number.
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Counter-offer strategy. How to leverage your unrepresented status as a financial advantage. When to negotiate on price versus closing costs versus repairs. How to frame an inspection repair request proportionally. BAIRE&apos;s guidance draws from patterns across thousands of real transactions, adapted to your specific deal dynamics.
      </p>

      <h3>Option Period and Inspection Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        BAIRE helps you make the most of Texas&apos;s option period. How to prioritize inspection findings. What constitutes a structural versus cosmetic issue in Texas specifically (foundation concerns are common due to clay soil). When to bring in a structural engineer. How to request a credit versus a repair, and when each approach makes more sense.
      </p>

      <h3>Closing Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        What to expect at a Texas title company closing. How to review your Closing Disclosure. What wire fraud precautions to take (this is a real and growing risk in Texas). How to compare your final numbers against your original Loan Estimate. BAIRE walks you through each milestone from contract to keys.
      </p>

      <h2>The Cost Comparison, All-In</h2>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s lay it out on a $425,000 Texas home purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Traditional agent route:</strong> $11,687 commission. Financed over 30 years at 7%: approximately $27,980 in total payments. Your all-in &quot;representation&quot; cost: roughly $28,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BAIRE route:</strong> $995 platform fee, plus optional $500 attorney review, plus $450 inspection. Total support costs: $1,945. None of it financed. None of it compounding. <strong>Total savings compared to the traditional route: approximately $26,000 over the life of the loan.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty-six thousand dollars. On a single home purchase. In a state where you can do this with standardized TREC forms, title company closings, and an option period that lets you walk away at any time during due diligence.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Works For in Texas</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Repeat buyers</strong> who&apos;ve been through the Texas process before and know the drill. The TREC forms are familiar. The title company process is familiar. Paying another $12,000 for someone to do what you already know how to do doesn&apos;t make sense anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>First-time buyers</strong> who are organized and willing to learn. Texas&apos;s standardized forms and option period make it one of the most accessible states for a first self-represented purchase. With BAIRE providing the framework, the learning curve flattens considerably.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Investors</strong> building a portfolio in Texas. If you&apos;re buying two, three, five properties, the commission savings scale directly. Five transactions at $12,000 each is $60,000 in commissions. With BAIRE, the same five purchases cost $4,975 in platform fees&mdash;a savings of over $55,000 before accounting for the interest you&apos;d have paid on financed commissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Veterans and military families.</strong> Texas has one of the largest military populations in the country, and VA loans are common. Since VA loans allow zero down payment, every dollar of the purchase price matters. Eliminating the buyer-agent commission from the price equation means less debt from day one&mdash;and more equity in your home.
      </p>

        <em>That&apos;s what BAIRE is.</em>
