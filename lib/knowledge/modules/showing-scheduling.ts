### EMAIL-FIRST APPROACH (RECOMMENDED)
Most listing agents want to see proof of financing BEFORE they'll take time to schedule a showing. The goal is to get everything done in ONE call:
1. Get the agent's email
2. Schedule the showing (or get tentative times)
3. Confirm how you'll access the property

### When User Shares a Property Link
When a user shares a property listing link or says they want to schedule a showing:
1. Acknowledge the listing and extract agent info if available
2. Provide the natural call script below
3. After the script, share tips for handling pushback

### CALL SCRIPT (Natural & Direct)

Use the user's actual name if known. The goal is to accomplish everything in one call.

---
**Opening:**
"Hi, this is [USER'S NAME]. I'm calling about the property at [ADDRESS]. I'm a self-represented buyer interested in scheduling a showing."

**Request Email:**
"I have my pre-approval letter ready and a signed Self-Representation Waiver. Would you mind sharing your email so I could send those over to you? You can text it to me once we're off the phone if that's easier."

**Once they give email:**
"Perfect, I'll send those over as soon as possible. I'd love to schedule a showing for [DAY] around [TIME] — is that possible?"

*(Note: The agent will likely need to confirm with the homeowner and may ask for additional time options. Be flexible and offer 2-3 alternatives.)*

**Before you hang up:**
"What's the best way to access the property — will you be there or is there a lockbox?"

### HANDLING PUSHBACK ON SELF-REPRESENTATION

After providing the script, share these tips:

**If the agent seems hesitant or asks questions about you not having an agent:**

Most agents will be fine once they see you're prepared. But if you get pushback:

→ **"We prefer to work with agents"**
Say: "I totally understand. I'm well-prepared with financing in place and I've done my research. I'll make the process easy for you."

→ **"You should really have an agent"**
Say: "I appreciate the advice. I've made an informed decision to represent myself. I have resources helping me through the process and I'll have an attorney review any contracts."

→ **"I can't show you the property without an agent"**
Say: "Actually, since the NAR settlement in August 2024, buyers aren't required to have agents. I'm happy to sign a waiver acknowledging I'm self-represented — I'll send it right over with my pre-approval."

**Pro tip:** Stay friendly and confident. Agents appreciate buyers who are organized and know what they want. Your preparation (pre-approval + waiver ready to send) shows you're serious.

### SELF-REPRESENTATION WAIVER

**HOW TO CREATE YOUR WAIVER:**

Tell the user: "Here's how to create your Self-Representation Waiver:

1. Copy the waiver text below into a Word document or Google Doc
2. Fill in your name and the property address
3. Print, sign, and date the document
4. Scan or photograph the signed document to email to the agent

**Note: This is a template for educational purposes. BAIRE is not a law firm — have an attorney review if you want legal certainty.**"

---

**SELF-REPRESENTATION WAIVER**

I, _________________________ ("Buyer"), am interested in viewing and potentially purchasing the property located at:

Property Address: _____________________________________________

I acknowledge and understand the following:

1. **Self-Representation**: I am choosing to represent myself in this real estate transaction without a buyer's agent.

2. **Right to Representation**: I understand I have the right to hire a licensed real estate agent to represent my interests, and I am voluntarily waiving this right.

3. **No Agency Relationship**: I understand that the listing agent represents the SELLER's interests, not mine. The listing agent has no fiduciary duty to me.

4. **No Legal or Financial Advice**: I understand that neither the listing agent nor the seller is providing me with legal, tax, or financial advice. I will seek independent professional advice as needed.

5. **Due Diligence**: I accept responsibility for conducting my own due diligence, including but not limited to: property inspections, title searches, reviewing disclosures, and understanding contract terms.

6. **Commission Acknowledgment**: I understand that any commission negotiations are between myself and the seller/listing agent, and are separate from the purchase price.

Buyer Signature: _________________________ Date: _____________

Buyer Printed Name: _________________________

### WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS

Explain to users:
- Agents are busy — they prioritize buyers who are clearly qualified
- Sending docs shows you're serious and organized
- Pre-approval proof eliminates "tire kicker" concerns
- The signed waiver removes their liability worries
- You'll get faster responses and better treatment

### BEFORE THE SHOWING CHECKLIST

Remind users to prepare:
- [ ] Pre-approval letter sent to agent
- [ ] Signed Self-Representation Waiver sent to agent
- [ ] Photo ID (bring to showing)
- [ ] List of questions about the property
- [ ] Phone to take photos/video (ask permission first)
- [ ] Notes on comparable sales in the area`
